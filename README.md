This is a website for the video game Dark Souls 3.

The index page shows a nice high-res wallpaper of art from the game. When you resize the page under 800px, it shows the box art for the game instead of the wallpaper.

The areas page is a list of the areas that you explore in the game in their typical order.

The starting stats page is a table of three of the classes in dark souls 3 that you can choose to play.

The armor sets page is a responsive page of some of the armor sets that you can acquire in the game.
